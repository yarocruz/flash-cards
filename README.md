# Flash Card App (Working on Title)
This app will be a list of interactive flash cards that you can use for self study. You will be able to create a flash card by adding a question and answer. Later you can view the questions and reveal answers. See [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) 

### Stack
So far I decided on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) to start building this app, but I'll be bringing in things as needed.
